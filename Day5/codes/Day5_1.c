    double

    int
    char 
if 2 operands are of diff type then smaller 
type is promoted to larger type for calculation 


 int + int => int 
 int + double => double 
 char * int => int 
 short / int => int 
 int / float => float 

 char and short are promoted to "int"
 for arithmatic calculation 
    char + char => int 
    short + char => int 
    char + short => int 

    (float)23 => 23 is an integer consider it as a float 
    for this calculation
